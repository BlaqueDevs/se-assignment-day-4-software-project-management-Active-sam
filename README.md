# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
##1. Why is timely delivery so important in software project management, and how can managers make sure deadlines are hit?
 Timely delivery keeps clients happy, saves money, and beats the competition. Managers can nail it by setting doable goals, tracking progress with tools like Jira, keeping the team 
 talking, and leaving room for surprises.

##2. How does keeping costs in check help a software project succeed, and what tricks stop budget blowouts?
 Good cost control means the project stays affordable and delivers value. To avoid overspending, plan a solid budget with wiggle room, watch spending live, lock down scope changes, and 
 match resources to needs.

##3. How do Agile and Waterfall methods differ, and what are their pros and cons?
 Agile is flexible and fast with constant updates—great for adapting, but it can get messy without clear goals. Waterfall is step-by-step and structured—perfect for fixed plans, but 
 stiff when changes pop up.

##4. When does Agile beat Waterfall, or the other way around? Give examples.
 Agile shines in shifting projects, like a startup tweaking an app based on users. Waterfall rules for set-in-stone jobs, like a government payroll system with strict rules.

##5. How do you keep quality high in a software project, and why does it matter?
 Run tests often, review code together, and get users to try it out. High quality cuts bugs, keeps users smiling, and saves headaches later—nobody likes a flaky app.

##6. Why does nailing the project scope matter for planning, and what’s a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) good for?
 A clear scope stops the project from ballooning and keeps everyone on the same page. A WBS breaks it into bite-sized tasks—like “Design” into “Sketch” and “Build”—making it easier to 
 manage and track.

##7. What’s the upside of a detailed project schedule, and how do Gantt charts help?
 A solid schedule spots overlaps and keeps things moving. Gantt charts lay it out visually—tasks, timing, who’s on what—so you can see the big picture and dodge delays.

##8. What problems does your software tackle, and why do they bug your audience?
 It fights confusion, bad info, and slow answers. People hate wading through junk to figure stuff out—it’s a time suck and a trust killer.

##9. How does pinning down the problem lead to better software?
 Knowing exactly what’s wrong keeps the team laser-focused on fixing it, not chasing random ideas. It’s like aiming an arrow instead of throwing darts blindfolded.

##10. How would you sum up your software without getting techy?
 Think of it as a sharp buddy who cuts the crap and gives you straight answers—quick and easy, no fluff.

##11. What makes your software special?
 It’s got fast, no-nonsense replies, digs into real-time info like posts or uploads, and keeps learning. It’s like a brain that never sleeps.

##12. What’s the market size and growth vibe for your software?
 AI stuff like this is huge—think $136 billion in 2022, growing fast at 37% a year ‘til 2030. People want smart tools now more than ever.

##13. How do market trends shape your software’s game plan?
 Seeing folks lean into AI and crave real info helps position it as the go-to helper. It’s about building what they’ll need tomorrow, not just today.
